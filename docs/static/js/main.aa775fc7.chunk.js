It would be with me 24/7 regardless of location and activity. Now imagine if you had a backpack that you had to carry with you 24/7, all the time, for the rest of your life. Whether you went to a meeting, on a date, on vacation, at work, whatever, you had to carry that backpack with you. Wouldn\u2019t you do everything you can to have that backpack look pristine?

It started out with me buying a scale, reducing the amount of food I ate, and starting to exercise every day. From March to June, I would just run a lot, and do calisthenics outside. And then in June, I got a membership at a local Muay Thai gym and started going to Muay Thai class every day. The Muay Thai thing was important because it gave me intensity. And intensity is absolutely key. You have to push yourself to experience this stuff. In order to experience the benefits I\u2019m going to describe, doing an exercise session with moderate intensity isn\u2019t enough.

I will add, however, that having a coach really helps in getting intensity. When I go to the Muay Thai gym, I would never push myself as much as the coaches push me.

But the real discovery, the whole thing I want to share with you, is how significant of an impact exercising every day and cleaning up my diet had on my psyche, on my mental, on my brain. Once I started doing this, I started to live, and feel, completely differently. Let me go over some of the mental benefits I\u2019ve experienced."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"First of all, my sleep. All my life, I\u2019ve struggled with my sleep schedule. I\u2019ve always wanted to be the kind of person that consistently gets out of bed early in the morning, and goes to sleep at a reasonable time in the evening. And while I managed to keep at it for 7 or 10 days in the past, it\u2019s never something I was able to do in a perennial, long-term way. Of course, when I had obligations, like school or work, I\u2019d be able to white knuckle it during the week, but I\u2019d just get increasingly sleep deprived as the week progressed, and then find myself quote unquote catching up by sleeping until 12 PM on the weekend. Until now."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Before I starting working out every day, I would get to bed at around 12 AM, and then most days, I\u2019d lay in bed watching YouTube for a few hours until I was completely exhausted and I would finally go to sleep at 2, 3, or 4 in the morning. This makes sense because to sleep well, we have to be exhausted. You don\u2019t just fall asleep when you decide to, when you get to bed at midnight. You fall asleep when you\u2019re really tired and your body needs it. So what would I do? I\u2019d decide to sleep at 12 and go to bed, find out I wasn\u2019t exhausted, exhaust myself by watching YouTube, then sleep. I\u2019m sure many of you can relate to the struggle of keeping a decent sleep schedule going."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"But this completely changed when I started exercising every day. Now that I exercise intensely during the day, I get to bed at 12 and, sure, I still love YouTube and sometimes I still feel like consuming it in the evening, it\u2019s not like my craving for it has magically disappeared, but now, I\u2019m tired as hell. I don\u2019t really want to watch YouTube, I just want to sleep."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Also, the exhaustion I experience now is a different kind of exhaustion than what I used to get by being on my phone for hours at night. This is the good kind of exhaustion. When you only exhaust yourself mentally, sure, you might be able to sleep at some point, but when you\u2019re physically exhausted, when you\u2019ve pushed your body, you\u2019re also exhausted, but it\u2019s a different kind of fatigue. It\u2019s the physical kind. If you\u2019re anything like me, you may have experienced this before as a kid when you went on vacation with your family and, during the day, you were very active physically. Maybe you spent your day hiking or biking or skiing or walking all over a new city or something like that. And then, in the evening, you go to bed and you sleep super well. I used to get that when I was a kid on vacation and I would be active all day, and I would really enjoy it. But what I hadn\u2019t realized is that you don\u2019t need to spend your entire day doing physical activity to feel that way at night. An hour of intense physical exercise is enough."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"And here\u2019s the other thing that happens in the evening when you\u2019ve had an intense workout during the day. You turn the light off, and you get comfortable in bed, and it feels like heaven. Your muscles are sore and tired from the physical exhaustion, and you\u2019re about to give them well-deserved, natural, healthy rest, and you get this massive amount of pleasure and satisfaction from getting to bed at the moment you need it. Going to bed has always felt great to me, but that feeling is multiplied many times over now that I exercise intensely every day."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"The second benefit I experience is that I feel better, both physically and mentally. Working out is always painful during the actual workout, but when I come home, take a shower, and sit at my desk again, I feel amazing. First of all, I\u2019m in a much, much better mood after I work out. I\u2019m not exactly sure why this happens, but I think it has to do with the fact that when we work out, our body releases endorphins, which is something I can definitely feel. I\u2019m much more positive, optimistic, calm and cheerful after I\u2019ve exercised. And then, once I take a shower and sit at my desk again, I feel physically at rest. Much like the sleep thing, this is very hard to describe, but the best way I can describe it is that, from the moment I stop exercising, I have a sort of tension, almost like electricity, that builds up inside of me. Kind of like before a thunderstorm, when you can feel the air getting heavy and it\u2019s warm and humid outside. The workout is like the thunderstorm that finally comes and clears out all the buildup. Once I\u2019ve worked out, I get rid of all that tension that was building up inside of me, and when I go back to other activities, my body feels, peaceful and relieved. Again, I think this is mostly just caused by the rush of endorphins which I can feel in a very tangible way."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"I\u2019m also prone to anxiety, and once work out, I feel much less anxious. Again, during the most anxious periods of my life, when I struggled with it the most, I never thought that exercising could make such a big difference. But it really does, it really helps me be less anxious."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"The third benefit I experience is that working out has made me more disciplined. This makes sense for two reasons. First, when you\u2019re working out, you subject yourself to pain. When I\u2019m in the boxing gym and I\u2019m following the coach\u2019s instructions and doing all I can to one more push up, one more burpee, one more series of kicks, it hurts. My body is experiencing discomfort, and it wants to stop. But I push myself. And through that exercise, I get used to facing discomfort and pain. Discipline is a muscle you can train, and a great way to practice being disciplined is by subjecting yourself toa healthy degree of physical pain and discomfort, which exercising provides. When life throws hardship at you, you\u2019re much better equipped to face it if you\u2019re used to voluntarily subjecting yourself to hardship. It makes you tougher."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Achieving great things, and even simply facing normal life, is hard. Life throws all kinds of pains at us. And in order to face them, we must fight them. But the best way to fight life\u2019s obstacles is to be used to fighting oneself. You must fight yourself if you want to fight the world. And you probably do want to fight the world. You don\u2019t really have a choice anyway."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"In one of his letters to Lucilius, Seneca wrote that \u201cThe body should be treated more rigorously that it may not be disobedient to the mind.\u201d When I work out, I remind my body who\u2019s boss. I remind my body who\u2019s in charge. This is very uncomfortable because we have this incredibly powerful limbic system and all it wants to do is keep our body pleased and happy. So the exercise of reminding your body who\u2019s in charge(which in this case is the more rational, less instinctive part of the brain, aka the prefrontal cortex) builds up qualities that translate to many other situations in life. When life throws stuff at me, I always know that I subject myself to a lot of pain voluntarily, which builds up my willpower and my resilience, making the relative pains of life not as hard to endure. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t struggle with facing life\u2019s difficulties, but I do better with it than if I didn\u2019t exercise, that\u2019s for sure."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"The fourth benefit is that working out has made me more long-term focused,patient, less needy of instant gratification. Fitness is a long term journey. When you decide to get fit, you know you\u2019ll have to keep at it for weeks before you see noticeable results. In the same process that I described with discipline, if you practice focusing on the long term, you get better at it. This is massively useful, because most goals in life require long-term focus and tenacity. Fitness gets you practicing both of those."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"The next benefit is that working out has made me more productive. First of all, I can focus better. Again, I can\u2019t exactly explain why this is, but I\u2019m sure many of you watching this have experienced this in the past. When I don\u2019t work out for a while, I start getting restless and kind of fidgety. The feeling of electricity and energy that builds up inside of me that I previously mentioned makes it hard to just sit down and focus. My body feels like it\u2019s really longing to go out there and move. And once I do exercise, because I feel better, I do better work."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Earlier, I said that I used to believe exercising would take away from time I could put towards my career. But what I realized is that I\u2019m actually pretty much creating time out of thin air. What I mean by that is that the time I spend in the gym isn\u2019t time that I\u2019m stealing from productive activities. It\u2019s time that I\u2019m stealing from procrastinating and just scrolling social media or wasting time. So in that sense, it\u2019s pretty much like I\u2019m just magically creating time in my week that didn\u2019t really exist before, since it was just squandered away."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"Working out also gives structure to my day. I make most of my income fromworking as a freelance software developer, and I work from home. This means I have complete control over my hours, and if I want to procrastinate, work at night, and get up at 2 PM every day, I can. But that\u2019s not the way I want to live. My ideal schedule is one where I get up early, work during normal, daytime hours, and sleep at night. Knowing that every day, at 6 PM, I go to Muay Thai class, I really try my damn best to get my work done before then, because I know that I have that coming up. It structures my day and helps give me routine, which is massively important."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"And finally, the last benefit. Working out has made me more confident. I\u2019ve always been a very confident person but when I was starting to gain weight, part of my confidence went away. I felt like I didn\u2019t look as good as I could, and that I wasn\u2019t the best version of myself, which inevitably impacted my confidence. I never had a big lack of confidence or anything like that, but the idea that, when seeing someone in shape, that was \u201cother people\u201d, that \u201cother people\u201d were in shape and lean and that I wasn\u2019t, all because of my own choices and actions or lack thereof, that was unacceptable to me."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"But the beautiful thing is that the inverse holds true. Now, when I\u2019m out and about living my life, whether in a happy moment or a hard one, I always have this underlying foundation of knowing that I was able to get in shape, to take control of what I look like. This helps me internalize that I have my shit together, and really boosts my self-confidence. It\u2019s exactly like getting out of bed at the same time every day, or doing your bed every morning. It\u2019s something positive in your life that no matter what, you know you were able to at least succeed on that."}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:"In life, there are things that matter, and things that don\u2019t matter. And there are things that you can control, and things you can\u2019t.

It would be tragic if you got into a car accident or got a bad disease all of a sudden, but you have limited control over that. Well, the great thing about fitness is thatit falls within the intersection of things that matter and that you can control, and that\u2019s very empowering.

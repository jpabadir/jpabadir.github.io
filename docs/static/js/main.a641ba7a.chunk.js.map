Growing up, my brother was always very athletic and doing lots of sports and activities. And I also remember a few\n        years ago, talking with my friend Ben about another one of our friends who used to run super long distance trails and telling him &ldquo;wow, I don&rsquo;t understand how he could do\n        that&rdquo;, and Ben told me &ldquo;He likes the way it makes him feel&rdquo;. And back then, I didn&rsquo;t understand that at all.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now, I always knew that exercising was good for your body, and I always did it to some degree. As a kid and teenager, I did Judo, then fencing, Taekwondo, running, weightlifting. In my late\n        teens and the beginning of my twenties, I would go running and do body weight exercise fairly frequently. So throughout my life, I always exercised at least once per week, often more. But it\n        wasn&rsquo;t until recently that I experienced a true, life-changing revelation about exercise.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You see, I always viewed exercising as a second priority. My first priority has always been, and still is, my career. And up until recently, I didn&rsquo;t view my life in a very holistic way.\n        I knew that my main goal was making money, and I didn&rsquo;t think there was very much room for me to also be athletic while pursuing that endeavour.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I viewed exercising as something I had to do every two or three days because it&rsquo;s important to exercise, and throughout most of my life, I would do it out of duty. I would tell myself\n        things like &ldquo;okay well I exercised yesterday, so I can skip today and just do tomorrow&rdquo;.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Deep down, I did desire to be more muscular, and I would see very fit guys and have a sense of admiration towards them, but part of me thought that the time they spent taking care of their\n        body was time they couldn&rsquo;t spend on their careers, and that wasn&rsquo;t acceptable to me.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And here is the thing, too: I&rsquo;m blessed with good genetics and I always ate reasonably healthy meals, so despite eating lots of cookies and snacks and large portions at meals (which I\n        had to because I had a high metabolism), I always looked lean and quite athletic as a kid, and into my late teens until I was about 20. And so the incentive to start taking good care of your\n        body isn&rsquo;t as strong when you naturally look decent.\n      </p>\n      <ul className=\"ul1\">\n        <li className=\"li4\">Pictures of me at 15 (from Facebook, or the one with my family)</li>\n        <li className=\"li4\">Even better would be some video of me at 15 (could try to find from Facebook)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p className=\"p3\">Conflict (a moment where things are disturbed):</p>\n      <p>\n        But then, something happened. I hit my early twenties and made almost no changes to my diet or exercise. Why should I, right? It had worked well thus far and, after all, a young adult in their\n        early twenties still has a high metabolism, it&rsquo;s not like I was 45 years old and eating like I was when I was 17.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But I started gaining weight. At first, it wasn&rsquo;t really all that noticeable. All my life, I had a decent six pack and, when you&rsquo;re not consciously monitoring your body by taking\n        progress pictures or weighing yourself, you don&rsquo;t really realize at first that you&rsquo;re gaining weight. Weight gain is slow and subtle, and since you see yourself every day, you\n        don&rsquo;t feel like you look any different. You don&rsquo;t exactly remember what you used to look like.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But at some point, I started realizing that my stomach didn&rsquo;t feel lean and firm like it used to. And over time, I&rsquo;d take a closer look at myself and realize &ldquo;ok, this is\n        happening, I&rsquo;m actually starting to put on weight&rdquo;.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Again, this was a foreign experience to me. All my life, I had been eating without any restraint and had never put on any weight, and I didn&rsquo;t think that would start happening in my\n        early twenties. Maybe I was naive, but I was taken by surprise.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the same time as my weight gain, my mindset around life changed a bit. I started seeing my life more as an RPG. For those of you who may not know what an RPG is, it&rsquo;s a type of video\n        game where you play as one single character and as you play the game you can improve multiple aspects (or stats) of your character by doing\n        various tasks and missions. Those stats for your character (like strength, stamina, driving, flying) are displayed clearly and quantitatively,\n        meaning you get an actual number put on them, which makes it easy to see if you&rsquo;re improving, and rewardingand tangible when you do so. As\n        you take on more challenging tasks your stats improve, which allows you to take on even more challenging tasks.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And so if you think of your own life as an RPG (which it pretty much is), sure, you can just work on one stat and be really really strong at it (for me, the stat I was trying for was money),\n        but actually, it&rsquo;s pretty interesting to try and work on multiple stats, to be a more complete person. There is a lot to explore and learn in life.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my career is still my main focus in life, but nonetheless, the idea of life as a video game or an RPG, where you can level up your character on a bunch of\n        different fronts and slowly progress became really attractive to me.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        During that period of my life, which was late 2021 - early 2022, I had already started to try to make small improvements to several of skills. Around that time, I got my driver&rsquo;s\n        license, started learning Korean, got more serious about reading books, learned to cut my own hair, and bought a basic set of tools and started learning how to fix basic stuff around my\n        apartment. And I think all these little actions made me realize that, as long as I used my time well, I could make a lot of progress on various skills in my life without at all sacrificing my\n        career. And in fact, I realized that those other skills could make me a smarter, more well-rounded, better human and bring positive change to my entire life, including my career. I realized\n        that it doesn&rsquo;t take much time at all to slowly improve and gain basic competency on many skills, and that it doesn&rsquo;t take away from my focus on my career at all if I do so. I\n        could become a multi-faceted, complete person, which is really fun and rewarding, all the while putting most of my effort towards my career.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And here is the other really important thing I started thinking about at that time. You carry your body everywhere you go. My intention was never to make fitness my life&rsquo;s main focus,\n        but I realized that whatever I did want to do, and wherever I went, I was taking my body with me. It would be with me 24/7 regardless of location and activity. Now imagine if you had a\n        backpack that you had to carry with you 24/7, all the time, for the rest of your life. Whether you went to a meeting, on a date, on vacation, at work, whatever, you had to carry that backpack\n        with you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you do everything you can to have that backpack look pristine? I certainly would. In some situations, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if your backpack has grease stains and\n        scruffs, but in many other ones, it does.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This was very much a stick or twist moment for me. I could decide either to keep to my old paradigm and ways of viewing my identity, or I could make a change.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And so, on March 12, 2022, I decided to start taking my diet and my physique seriously. I know the exact date, because I keep a record in my Apple Notes of all the dates of important changes I\n        made that shaped my life. I decided that I would clean up my diet and exercise more. It started out with me buying a scale, reducing the amount of food I ate, and starting to exercise every\n        day. From March to June, I would just run a lot, and do calisthenics outside. And then in June, I got a membership at a local Muay Thai gym and started going to Muay Thai class every day. The\n        Muay Thai thing was important because it gave me intensity. And intensity is absolutely key. You have to push yourself to experience this stuff. In order to experience the benefits I&rsquo;m\n        going to describe, doing an exercise session with moderate intensity isn&rsquo;t enough. You need to break a good sweat, you need to really put in a lot of effort into your workouts.\n        Otherwise, it doesn&rsquo;t work nearly as well. Again, intensity is key.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Personally, these days, I do at least an hour of Muay Thai training every day, which completely drains me physicallyI think other sports can definitely bring you the same intensity and\n        benefits, depending on what you&rsquo;re into. I found a sport I&rsquo;m into and which I really enjoy practicing, but there is a plethora of great sports out there that can give you\n        intensity, so find something you like. I will add, however, that having a coach really helps in getting intensity. When I go to the Muay Thai gym, I would never push myself as much as the\n        coaches push me. That&rsquo;s why if you can join some kind of club rather than only practicing on your own, I would recommend doing so.\n      </p>\n      <ul className=\"ul1\">\n        <li className=\"li4\">Me at my fattest (can include the video Jaden took, but without the sound)</li>\n        <li className=\"li4\">\n          &ldquo;Every day I will be weighing myself on this very scale&rdquo; video\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"li4\">\n          Me doing calisthenics at bellevue park\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"li4\">Me at Muay Thai</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p className=\"p3\">\n        Resolution (what I found out):\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Now, when I started out with these changes, I knew very well what would happen to my body if I stuck to them: I&rsquo;d get leaner and more muscular. And I did. I haven&rsquo;t quite reached\n        my goals in terms of how I want my body to look yet, I still have a lot of room for improvement, but I lost weight, and I look much better than I used to. But the real discovery, the whole\n        thing I want to share with you, is how significant of an impact exercising every day and cleaning up my diet had on my psyche, on my mental, on my brain. Once I started doing this, I started\n        to live, and feel, completely differently. Let me go over some of the mental benefits I&rsquo;ve experienced.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        First of all, my sleep. All my life, I&rsquo;ve struggled with my sleep schedule. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be the kind of person that consistently gets out of bed early in the morning, and\n        goes to sleep at a reasonable time in the evening. And while I managed to keep at it for 7 or 10 days in the past, it&rsquo;s never something I was able to do in a perennial, long-term way. Of\n        course, when I had obligations, like school or work, I&rsquo;d be able to white knuckle it during the week, but I&rsquo;d just get increasingly sleep deprived as the week progressed, and then\n        find myself quote unquote catching up by sleeping until 12 PM on the weekend. Until now.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Before I starting working out every day, I would get to bed at around 12 AM, and then most days, I&rsquo;d lay in bed watching YouTube for a few hours until I was completely exhausted and I\n        would finally go to sleep at 2, 3, or 4 in the morning. This makes sense because to sleep well, we have to be exhausted. You don&rsquo;t just fall asleep when you decide to, when you get to\n        bed at midnight. You fall asleep when you&rsquo;re really tired and your body needs it. So what would I do? I&rsquo;d decide to sleep at 12 and go to bed, find out I wasn&rsquo;t exhausted,\n        exhaust myself by watching YouTube, then sleep. I&rsquo;m sure many of you can relate to the struggle of keeping a decent sleep schedule going.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But this completely changed when I started exercising every day. Now that I exercise intensely during the day, I get to bed at 12 and, sure, I still love YouTube and sometimes I still feel\n        like consuming it in the evening, it&rsquo;s not like my craving for it has magically disappeared, but now, I&rsquo;m tired as hell. I don&rsquo;t really want to watch YouTube, I just want to\n        sleep.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Also, the exhaustion I experience now is a different kind of exhaustion than what I used to get by being on my phone for hours at night. This is the good kind of exhaustion. When you only\n        exhaust yourself mentally, sure, you might be able to sleep at some point, but when you&rsquo;re physically exhausted, when you&rsquo;ve pushed your body, you&rsquo;re also exhausted, but\n        it&rsquo;s a different kind of fatigue. It&rsquo;s the physical kind. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you may have experienced this before as a kid when you went on vacation with your family\n        and, during the day, you were very active physically. Maybe you spent your day hiking or biking or skiing or walking all over a new city or something like that. And then, in the evening, you\n        go to bed and you sleep super well. I used to get that when I was a kid on vacation and I would be active all day, and I would really enjoy it. But what I hadn&rsquo;t realized is that you\n        don&rsquo;t need to spend your entire day doing physical activity to feel that way at night. An hour of intense physical exercise is enough.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And here&rsquo;s the other thing that happens in the evening when you&rsquo;ve had an intense workout during the day. You turn the light off, and you get comfortable in bed, and it feels like\n        heaven. Your muscles are sore and tired from the physical exhaustion, and you&rsquo;re about to give them well-deserved, natural, healthy rest, and you get this massive amount of pleasure and\n        satisfaction from getting to bed at the moment you need it. Going to bed has always felt great to me, but that feeling is multiplied many times over now that I exercise intensely every day.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The second benefit I experience is that I feel better, both physically and mentally. Working out is always painful during the actual workout, but when I come home, take a shower, and sit at my\n        desk again, I feel amazing. First of all, I&rsquo;m in a much, much better mood after I work out. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why this happens, but I think it has to do with the fact that when\n        we work out, our body releases endorphins, which is something I can definitely feel. I&rsquo;m much more positive, optimistic, calm and cheerful after I&rsquo;ve exercised. And then, once I\n        take a shower and sit at my desk again, I feel physically at rest. Much like the sleep thing, this is very hard to describe, but the best way I can describe it is that, from the moment I stop\n        exercising, I have a sort of tension, almost like electricity, that builds up inside of me. Kind of like before a thunderstorm, when you can feel the air getting heavy and it&rsquo;s warm and\n        humid outside. The workout is like the thunderstorm that finally comes and clears out all the buildup. Once I&rsquo;ve worked out, I get rid of all that tension that was building up inside of\n        me, and when I go back to other activities, my body feels, peaceful and relieved. Again, I think this is mostly just caused by the rush of endorphins which I can feel in a very tangible way.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I&rsquo;m also prone to anxiety, and once work out, I feel much less anxious. Again, during the most anxious periods of my life, when I struggled with it the most, I never thought that\n        exercising could make such a big difference. But it really does, it really helps me be less anxious.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The third benefit I experience is that working out has made me more disciplined. This makes sense for two reasons. First, when you&rsquo;re working out, you subject yourself to pain. When\n        I&rsquo;m in the boxing gym and I&rsquo;m following the coach&rsquo;s instructions and doing all I can to one more push up, one more burpee, one more series of kicks, it hurts. My body is\n        experiencing discomfort, and it wants to stop. But I push myself. And through that exercise, I get used to facing discomfort and pain. Discipline is a muscle you can train, and a great way to\n        practice being disciplined is by subjecting yourself toa healthy degree of physical pain and discomfort, which exercising provides. When life\n        throws hardship at you, you&rsquo;re much better equipped to face it if you&rsquo;re used to voluntarily subjecting yourself to hardship. It makes you tougher.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Achieving great things, and even simply facing normal life, is hard. Life throws all kinds of pains at us. And in order to face them, we must fight them. But the best way to fight life&rsquo;s\n        obstacles is to be used to fighting oneself. You must fight yourself if you want to fight the world. And you probably do want to fight the world. You don&rsquo;t really have a choice anyway.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In one of his letters to Lucilius, Seneca wrote that &ldquo;The body should be treated more rigorously that it may not be disobedient to the mind.&rdquo; When I work out, I remind my body\n        who&rsquo;s boss. I remind my body who&rsquo;s in charge. This is very uncomfortable because we have this incredibly powerful limbic system and all it wants to do is keep our body pleased and\n        happy. So the exercise of reminding your body who&rsquo;s in charge(which in this case is the more rational, less instinctive part of the brain,\n        aka the prefrontal cortex) builds up qualities that translate to many other situations in life. When life throws stuff at me, I always know that I subject myself to a lot of pain voluntarily,\n        which builds up my willpower and my resilience, making the relative pains of life not as hard to endure. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t struggle with facing life&rsquo;s\n        difficulties, but I do better with it than if I didn&rsquo;t exercise, that&rsquo;s for sure.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The fourth benefit is that working out has made me more long-term focused,patient, less needy of instant gratification. Fitness is a long term\n        journey. When you decide to get fit, you know you&rsquo;ll have to keep at it for weeks before you see noticeable results. In the same process that I described with discipline, if you practice\n        focusing on the long term, you get better at it. This is massively useful, because most goals in life require long-term focus and tenacity. Fitness gets you practicing both of those.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The next benefit is that working out has made me more productive. First of all, I can focus better. Again, I can&rsquo;t exactly explain why this is, but I&rsquo;m sure many of you watching\n        this have experienced this in the past. When I don&rsquo;t work out for a while, I start getting restless and kind of fidgety. The feeling of electricity and energy that builds up inside of me\n        that I previously mentioned makes it hard to just sit down and focus. My body feels like it&rsquo;s really longing to go out there and move. And once I do exercise, because I feel better, I do\n        better work.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Earlier, I said that I used to believe exercising would take away from time I could put towards my career. But what I realized is that I&rsquo;m actually pretty much creating time out of thin\n        air. What I mean by that is that the time I spend in the gym isn&rsquo;t time that I&rsquo;m stealing from productive activities. It&rsquo;s time that I&rsquo;m stealing from procrastinating\n        and just scrolling social media or wasting time. So in that sense, it&rsquo;s pretty much like I&rsquo;m just magically creating time in my week that didn&rsquo;t really exist before, since it\n        was just squandered away.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Working out also gives structure to my day. I make most of my income fromworking as a freelance software developer, and I work from home. This\n        means I have complete control over my hours, and if I want to procrastinate, work at night, and get up at 2 PM every day, I can. But that&rsquo;s not the way I want to live. My ideal schedule\n        is one where I get up early, work during normal, daytime hours, and sleep at night. Knowing that every day, at 6 PM, I go to Muay Thai class, I really try my damn best to get my work done\n        before then, because I know that I have that coming up. It structures my day and helps give me routine, which is massively important.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And finally, the last benefit. Working out has made me more confident. I&rsquo;ve always been a very confident person but when I was starting to gain weight, part of my confidence went away. I\n        felt like I didn&rsquo;t look as good as I could, and that I wasn&rsquo;t the best version of myself, which inevitably impacted my confidence. I never had a big lack of confidence or anything\n        like that, but the idea that, when seeing someone in shape, that was &ldquo;other people&rdquo;, that &ldquo;other people&rdquo; were in shape and lean and that I wasn&rsquo;t,\n        all because of my own choices and actions or lack thereof, that was unacceptable to me.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But the beautiful thing is that the inverse holds true. Now, when I&rsquo;m out and about living my life, whether in a happy moment or a hard one, I always have this underlying foundation of\n        knowing that I was able to get in shape, to take control of what I look like. This helps me internalize that I have my shit together, and really boosts my self-confidence. It&rsquo;s exactly\n        like getting out of bed at the same time every day, or doing your bed every morning. It&rsquo;s something positive in your life that no matter what, you know you were able to at least succeed\n        on that.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In life, there are things that matter, and things that don&rsquo;t matter. And there are things that you can control, and things you can&rsquo;t. And one of the problems we face is that many\n        of the things that matter in life are also things we don&rsquo;t have much control over. It would be tragic if you got into a car accident or got a bad disease all of a sudden, but you have\n        limited control over that. Well, the great thing about fitness is thatit falls within the intersection of things that matter and that you can\n        control, and that&rsquo;s very empowering.

A habit which triggers many other positive changes in your life. Now that I&rsquo;ve experienced what life is like when I exercise every day, it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine\n        going back and living life without a daily workout, and I plan on really doing everything in my power to prioritize getting one intense workout in every single day for the foreseeable future.\n        \n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So far in my life, there have only been a few of such life-changing discoveries. But on the rare occasions when I do stumble upon one of such revelations, it does make me wonder. First of all,\n        what other life-changing revelations and discoveries will I experience in the future. And secondly, how do I provoke more life-changing discoveries? Is there a method I can come up with, or\n        some tangible actions I can take, to trigger more of such discoveries? I don&rsquo;t know! I have a few ideas, but I&rsquo;m hoping that as I go through life, I can find answers to both of\n        these questions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The other thing I want to leave you with is this: if what I described in this video intrigues you, and you&rsquo;re going to try exercising more, keep in mind that for many people who love\n        exercising, myself included, we still have to discipline ourselves to get to the gym. Especially after taking a break for a few days and getting back into it, it always feel painful and\n        awkward. But it&rsquo;s always 100% worth it, and if you find a sport you enjoy and which gives you intensity, I&rsquo;m confident you can enjoy the same benefits as the ones I&rsquo;ve\n        described here. So, give it a try! I doubt you&rsquo;ll regret it.\n      </p> */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","var map = {\n\t\"./blogs-headers\": 22,\n\t\"./blogs-headers copy\": 34,\n\t\"./blogs-headers copy.json\": 34,\n\t\"./blogs-headers.json\": 22,\n\t\"./everyone-should-have-perfect-grammar\": 35,\n\t\"./everyone-should-have-perfect-grammar.js\": 35,\n\t\"./how-working-out-every-day-completely-changed-my-life\": 36,\n\t\"./how-working-out-every-day-completely-changed-my-life.js\": 36\n};\n\n\nfunction webpackContext(req) {\n\tvar id = webpackContextResolve(req);\n\treturn __webpack_require__(id);\n}\nfunction webpackContextResolve(req) {\n\tif(!__webpack_require__.o(map, req)) {\n\t\tvar e = new Error(\"Cannot find module '\" + req + \"'\");\n\t\te.code = 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND';\n\t\tthrow e;\n\t}\n\treturn map[req];\n}\nwebpackContext.keys = function webpackContextKeys() {\n\treturn Object.keys(map);\n};\nwebpackContext.resolve = webpackContextResolve;\nmodule.exports = webpackContext;\nwebpackContext.id = 56;","export const linkify = (linkName) => {\n  return linkName.replace(/\\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase();\n};\n","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport { Outlet, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { linkify } from '../../helpers';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const navItems = [\n    { name: 'Home', link: '/' },\n    { name: 'YouTube', link: 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCliwHW2THGTsKwNvNcF_Nlw' },\n    { name: 'Articles' },\n    { name: \"Books I've read\", link: 'books-i-read' },\n    { name: \"Countries I've been to\", link: 'countries' },\n    { name: 'Investment Portfolio' },\n  ];\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <div className=\"customNavbarClass\">\n        {navItems.map((item) => {\n          return item.link && item.link.includes('https') ?

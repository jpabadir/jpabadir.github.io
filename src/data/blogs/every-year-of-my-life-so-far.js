              I don't remember any of this. Actually yeah, I skipped the second
              year of kindergarten, and I remember that. I was too smart and
              bored with the other kids. I was a genius. I'm not anymore.

              My grandpa got me a soldering iron against my mom's will and I

              Almost set my parents' house on fire trying to make a hot air

              My cousin lent me his iPod and I listened to "The Real Slim Shady"

            <i>Pure Heroin</i> by Lorde was released. I listened to it on repeat
            while staring out the window of my dad's car pretending I was the
            main character in some movie and I was deeply misunderstood.

            My brother started playing guitar. After a month, he could play
            songs and I realized "this is not that hard!" so I started playing
            too. He stopped, I continued.

            My mom forced me to go to my high school's pre-orientation meeting.
            I fought her on it but she won. I ended up listening to a talk by
            the principal of the private native English-speaking section of the
            school who was encouraging people to apply even if they weren't sure
            they could get in. I thought "I'm not sure I can get in" and
            applied. I got in. This significantly changed the course of my life,
            since it allowed me to learn English and move to Canada 3 years
            later. Thanks, mom...

              Had extra time and decided to open up codecademy again. This time,

              Started a software development consultancy with my friend Noah. We
              printed out business cards, took the bus to the mall, and
              solicited every business. We found one client and made a web app
              for them. We made $6K CAD. I was rich. We fucked up and
              accidentally deleted their database. I decided we should refund
              them. I was poor again. We closed down the business after this, we
              had to focus on our studies and internships anyway.

              Started working out seriously and really enjoying it. The

              few lbs of fat I had, and went from 163 to 154 lbs.

              Started lifting weights. Until then, I thought people who lifted
              were meatheads. I was wrong. Started focusing on gaining muscle
              and putting on weight. Went from 154 to 176 lbs.
